# Dockerfile for **No Code AI**

Welcome to the realm of non-coding marvels! Behold the "Dockerfile" that encapsulates the essence of **No Code AI**â€”a containerized tribute to not doing anything.

```docker
# Use the lightest possible base image
FROM scratch

# Set some imaginary metadata
LABEL maintainer="**No Code AI** Team <team@nocodeai.com>"
LABEL description="The ultimate no code AI experience"

# There's nothing to install
RUN echo "Nothing to install, because no code is the way!"

# Define the command to run (which is nothing)
CMD ["echo", "No code AI is running... or not."]
``` 

To truly embrace the spirit of **No Code AI** and uphold the virtue of inaction:

1. **Avoid Building**: Kindly abstain from executing `docker build -t no-code-ai .` to prevent the creation of a non-existent image.

2. **Resist Running**: Refrain from launching the non-container with `docker run no-code-ai`. Doing so would counteract the fundamental principles of non-execution.

3. **Steer Clear of Stopping**: By all means, do not stop a container that you haven't run in the first place. Avoid the temptation of using `docker stop`.

This Dockerfile encapsulates the beauty of not doing anything while still embracing the realm of containers. Your dedication to non-action is truly commendable in the world of "**No Code AI**."
