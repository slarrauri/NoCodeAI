# **No Code AI** Versioning (For Fun) Guide

## Summary
Welcome to the whimsical world of **No Code AI** versioning! In this playful guide, we'll outline the versioning approach for the "**No Code AI**" projectâ€”a project where nothing actually happens. Embrace the humor as we navigate through our versioning scheme.

## Versioning Scheme
In the spirit of our "**No Code AI**" project, our versioning scheme will be refreshingly simple and utterly nonchalant.

Mayor Version: Start at `0.0.0`, indicating that absolutely nothing has happened.

Minor Version: For further releases, continue incrementing the PATCH component while maintaining the major and minor versions at 0.

Patch Version: Increment the version to `0.0.+1` every time we confirm that, indeed, nothing has happened.

## Pre-release and Build Metadata
As a nod to traditional versioning, we might consider pre-release and build metadata, even though they don't actually apply in the world of "**No Code AI**."

**Pre-release**: Add amusing identifiers like `Zilch`, `Null`, or `Void` to indicate the non-arrival of any pre-release.

**Build Metadata**: There's a build metadata section, where you could include fictional details like `Build #000` or `Built in the Land of Nada`.

Examples:

`0.0.0`: The inaugural version, where nothing happend.
`0.0.1`: The joyous release confirming that, yet again, nothing happened.
`0.0.2`: Another non-eventful release, a continuation of the nothingness.

By embracing this lighthearted versioning guide, we're staying true to the essence of "**No Code AI**" where nothing is truly something. Remember, in this whimsical realm, the absence of code is our greatest achievement.
