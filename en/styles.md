# **No Code AI** Style Guide 

Welcome to the **No Code AI** Style Guide, where simplicity reigns supreme. Remember, the essence of no code lies in doing nothing. Any code you write is a liability.

## File Extensions
In the no code world, files are more of a theoretical concept than a reality. However, if you insist on using files, employ the ".no" file extension.

Example:
```nocodeai
main.no
```


## Linters
Linters in the no code universe are delightfully straightforward. The "du" command is your best friend for identifying potential non-issues.

Example:
```nocodeai
du -h main.no
0       main.no
```


## The No Code Principle
No code adheres to the principle of absolute nothingness. Any attempt to inject code into the no code paradigm is contrary to its essence.

## Code Reviews
When navigating the realms of no code, our community has established an effortless code review process:

**No Code Changes**: If the change contributes no code additions or alterations, respond with the acronym:
- **LGTM**: Looks Good To Me

**Code Modifications**: If the change dares to introduce code-related alterations:
- **CIAL**: Code Is A Liability

Embrace these conventions, for they embody the essence of no code. Any change involving code should be swiftly dismissed. Remember, no code is the true path to simplicity and reliability.
